# API's allow one program to interface with another. Think about how Windows, Linux, and Mac offer
# a GUI to allow you to interface with your computer without having to run bash commands for every single
# thing you want to do. API's allow your software to interface with another piece of software without
# having to implement the other software yourself. They abstract away implementation details of the
# software being interfaced with.

# The key word is interface. A tv remote is an interface to interact with your TV. The tv remote
# only exposes the buttons, not the underlying circuitry and processes that actually control the tv.
# Just as a server hosting a REST API only exposes the endpoints, not the underlying code that backs said
# endpoints. API's allow your software to interface with certain features of another piece of software
# without needing to care about the implementation details of said feature. Implementation details are
# abstracted away.

# A REST API is an API hosted on a web server that provides RESTful endpoints to interface with functionality
# of the server.
